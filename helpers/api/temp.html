Antarctica
is the highest, driest, windiest, emptiest, coldest place on
earth.
  <p></p>
  <p>An
ice sheet covers all but 2.4 percent of Antarctica's 14 million square
kilometers.</p>
  <p>At
its thickest point the ice sheet is 4,776 meters deep and averages 2,
160
meters thick. This is 90 percent of all the world's ice and it is 70
percent of
all the world's fresh water. </p>
  <p>There
are lots of penguins, whales, seals, krill (the main food for whales),
and even
fish in Antarctica's waters, but there are no land mammals and, as far
as scientists know, no native peoples.
  </p>
  <p>Eskimos and polar
bears are found in the ARCTIC, not the Antarctic.</p>
  <p>The
mean annual temperature at the South Pole is minus 56 degrees F. During
the Austral
Summer, temperatures at McMurdo base, on the Ross Sea, may get as high
as 40
degrees F, while at the South Pole, at the Amundsen- Scott station,
temperatures may reach 0 degrees F.</p>
  <p>The
area below 60 degrees south enjoys one long day and one long night each
year.
The sun sets in March and rises in October.</p>
  <p>The
seasons in Antarctica are the opposite of the seasons in the Northern
hemisphere--summer is October through February. Winter is March through
September.</p>
  <p>The
continent is roughly 14 million square kilometers (5.4 million square
miles).
The USA is only 9.36 million square kilometers (3.6 million square
miles). The
distance from Washington, D.C. to McMurdo station is approximately
14,830
kilometers, or 9,920 miles.</p>
  <p>Scientists
work on all kinds of unique projects in Antarctica, including
penguins, Antarctic cod (they have a special antifreeze agent in their
blood!), whales, seals, global warming, climatology, meteorites,
glaciology,
astronomy, volcanoes, UV radiation, and more. Scientists also study
humans in
Antarctica, doing research on how the human body adapts to cold and how
the
human mind and heart react to extreme isolation.</p>
  <p>The
Antarctic continent wasn't even actually seen until 1820. No man set
foot in
Antarctica until 1895. The first human landing there is claimed by
Henryk Bull,
with a party from a whaling ship. They landed at Cape Adare . It was
1935
before the first woman set foot there. Her name was Catherine
Mikkelson, and
she was the wife of a Norwegian whaling captain. The South Pole was
first
reached by a Norwegian named Roald Amundsen in 1911, and shortly after
by
British explorer Robert Scott.</p>

  <p>Most
tourists who visit Antarctica visit the Antarctic Peninsula, which is
accessible from Chile. There the climate is mild in comparison with the
rest
of the continent, and is teaming with wildlife. This part of Antarctica
is sometimes called the "Banana Belt."</p>
  <p>All
warm-blooded animals living on and around Antarctica--whales, seals,
sea birds,
penguins--rely on thick layers of blubber to insulate them from the
cold. The
layer of blubber on a Weddell seal can be up to 4 inches thick.
  </p>
  <p>Only
one warm-blooded animal remains on the Antarctic continent during the
bitter
winter--the emperor penguin. Emperor penguin females lay one egg in
June and
leave to spend the winter at sea. The male penguins stay on land all
winter,
surviving the most extreme conditions for nine weeks (including no
food!),
keeping their one egg warm by balancing it on their feet and covering
it with a
flap of abdominal skin. The females return just about the time the eggs
hatch.
  </p>
  <p>Plants
grow in Antarctica in ice-free regions (only about 2 percent of the
continent
is ice-free). Lichens and moss grow in any favorable niche, including
in sand,
soil, rock and on the weathered bones and feathers of dead animals.
Algae also
grows in Antarctica.</p>
  <p>Fifty
million years ago Antarctica had a temperate climate, evergreen forests
and
many more kinds of animals than it has today. As the icecap slowly
formed, most
of the animals that lived there in ancient times were obliterated.
Evidence of
this once warm climate is in the fossils of plants, including fossil
ferns,
found by scientists.</p>
  <p>Only
invertebrate animals live on the continent year-round. The largest
invertebrate
that makes its home permanently in Antarctica is a wingless midge
called
  <i>Beligica antarctica</i>. It is so tiny it can only be seen well
under a
microscope.</p>
  <p>One
of the most important animals in the seas around Antarctica is the
krill, a
tiny crustacean that is the main food source for baleen whales,
crabeater
seals, fur seals and Adelie penguins. Krill are crucial to the health
and
ecological balance of all the world's oceans.</p>
  <p>There
are many different species of penguins in Antarctica, including the
huge and
colorful emperor penguin, the smaller Adelie, the gentoo, the chinstrap
penguin, the rockhopper, the king, the macaroni and more. In all there
are 21
species of penguin scattered throughout the southern hemisphere.
Penguins are
great swimmers. They can swim so fast, if they're trying, for instance,
to
escape the jaws of a leopard seal, that they can shoot out of the water
7 feet
into the air onto a safe ice floe.</p>
  <p>Seals
in Antarctic waters include the Weddell seal, the Ross seal, the
crabeater, and
the leopard seal. On the Antarctic peninsula there are also elephant
seals and
fur seals. These southern seals are still recovering from the
devastation wrought by the 19th century sealers.</p>
  <p>Six
species of baleen whales and six species of toothed whales and dolphins
are
found in Antarctic waters. They include the blue, fin, southern right
whale,
sei whale, minke, and humpback; the sperm whale, killer whale,
hourglass
dolphin, fourtooth whale, rightwhale dolphin and the southern
bottlenose
whale.</p>
  <p>Penguins
are the group of Antarctic birds that everyone thinks of first, but
there are
actually more petrels than there are penguins! Petrels include
albatrosses,
fulmars, prions, shearwaters, storm petrels, diving petrels and Gadfly
petrels.
Petrels are found in all the world's oceans, but there are more in
Antarctic
waters than anywhere else.</p>
  <p>Other
birds that live in or breed in Antarctica include cormorants, gulls,
skuas and
terns and land birds including sheathbills and pintail ducks.
